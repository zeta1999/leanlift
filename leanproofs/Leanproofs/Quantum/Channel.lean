  D2 — quantum support library in Lean (LEAN_ERROR_PLAN.md LE3 / LEAN_EXPORT_PLAN.md Track D2).

  Foundation layer: density operators and CPTP maps in Kraus form over `Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℂ`.

  A density operator is positive-semidefinite with unit trace (`IsDensity`). A quantum channel
  is given by a finite Kraus decomposition `{Kᵢ}` satisfying the completeness relation
  `∑ᵢ Kᵢᴴ Kᵢ = 1`, acting as `ρ ↦ ∑ᵢ Kᵢ ρ Kᵢᴴ` (`KrausMap`/`KrausMap.apply`).

  The headline well-definedness result is `KrausMap.apply_isDensity`: every Kraus map sends
  density operators to density operators (trace preservation + positivity), i.e. it is CPTP.
  This is the trust-boundary object the noise models (depolarizing, amplitude/phase damping)
  are instances of in the LE3 fidelity-vs-noise proofs.

  Sorry-free; reuses mathlib's `Matrix.PosSemidef` / `Matrix.trace` API.

bundles Hermitian-ness, so this is the full standard definition.) -/

  ρ.PosSemidef ∧ ρ.trace = 1

/-- A finite Kraus decomposition of a quantum channel: `k` operators satisfying the
completeness relation `∑ᵢ Kᵢᴴ Kᵢ = 1`.  This is exactly the CPTP (trace-preserving,
completely positive) data in operator-sum form. -/

/-- **Trace preservation.** A Kraus map preserves trace: `Tr(E ρ) = Tr ρ`.
Uses the cyclic property `Tr(Kᵢ ρ Kᵢᴴ) = Tr(Kᵢᴴ Kᵢ ρ)` and completeness. -/

/-- **Positivity preservation.** A Kraus map sends positive-semidefinite operators to
positive-semidefinite operators (this is the "completely positive" half, at the
single-system level): each summand `Kᵢ ρ Kᵢᴴ` is PSD, and PSD is closed under sums. -/
